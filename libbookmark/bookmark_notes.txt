Bookmarks Manager
=================

Date: 2009-05-19

A first design of a bookmark manager.

Architecture:
-------------

Bookmark:

A simple object with 4 attributes: a title, an url, a parent directory and a favicon. (The last two are optional)

BookmarkManager:

Initialized with an optional BDirectory (the default one should be ~/config/settings/bookmarks).

Have 3 main methods,
- AddBookmark : Create a BFile from the attributes of a given Bookmark object and store it in the correct directory.
- GetBookmarkList : Return a BList of Bookmark objects from a given directory. A boolean argument can also be passed to determine whether recursion in sub-folders. This method would be useful to create a bookmark menu or a bookmark bar.
- ManageBookmarks : Open a Tracker window, in the BDirectory for which the BookmarkManager is set, to manage (reorganize, rename, delete) bookmarks.


Ideas:
------

In the present state the Bookmarks Manager doesn't handle the opening of a bookmark. In the case of opening it from the Tracker it's directly managed by Haiku. In the case of opening it from a bookmark menu (or bar) it would be the browser's job, as GetBookmarkList returns a List of Bookmarks. I am not sure it is the best way to do.

-------
There is an existing BUrl class that could be used for the url field of the Bookmark class.
Description from the source code file (/src/kits/support/Url.cpp):
"Url class for parsing an URL and opening it with its preferred handler."
As it was mainly written to manage the url mime type, is it really necessary to use it? (instead of a BString)
